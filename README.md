# Student-Homework-Registration-System

In this project, a student homework registration system was designed. 
Teachers can create and send homework with the homework information (homework subject, homework completion time, homework unit information) and student information (student name, student age and student class information). 
Students can view their homework and update their homework status from the student page. 
The teacher can follow the updated homework status information on his/her own page.
While designing this project, the topics of class, abstract, interface, extension methods, linq, nullable types, dynamic, exception handling, linq, delegate, asynchronous programming were discussed.
